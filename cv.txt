Anouska Hopkins

I'm a former assistant merchandiser about to embark on the October cohort of the Makers Academy to learn to code. I have produced analysis regularly at Crew Clothing and I excelled in my logic module during my Philosophy degree at Bristol. I am looking to leverage off these skills by becoming a developer and undertaking stimulating work with interesting people in a diverse environment.

Skills:

Problem-solving

Whilst working at Crew Clothing, I had the opportunity to improve processing efficiency through problem-solving. I detected faults in spreadsheets and systems which were slowing down the department's efficiency, communicated these faults to my peers, decided on what the ideal outcome would be, and worked towards fulfilling this objective. Following this achievement, I was given responsibility for ownership of these processes and spreadsheets.

Furthermore, this pro-active attitude contributed towards the promotion I obtained during my time there. I then increased the efficiency of the new department I was promoted to, for example, automating and enhancing the Monday trade reports.

Communication

Since joining the Philosophy department at Bristol University, my communication skills have been constantly improving through experiencing different types of working environments. During university we discussed complex philosophical theories that required communicating with clarity and evidence to reduce the risk of mis-understanding.

Moreover, while I was waitressing, I gave instructions to my peers in a pressurised environment to help avoid any injuries or errors occurring. This successful communication resulted in my becoming a team ambassador in charge of the wellbeing and organisation of the staff on duty.

Finally, at Crew Clothing I was asked to work for the menswear, womenswear and the accessories teams simultaneously. I contributed to a cohesive environment between these departments and I frequently taught my peers skills I had developed, for example, how to create and amend reports in our data management system, ZAP. I became the go-to person to provide essential skills for new starters within the teams.

Technical Knowledge: Microsoft office including Excel, ZAP Business Intelligence, Dynamics AX, Ruby.
