## Skills:

**Problem-solving**

* Passion for **debugging** on GitHub projects

* Whilst working at Crew Clothing, I had the opportunity to improve **processing efficiency** through problem-solving. 

* I detected faults in spreadsheets and systems which were slowing down the department's efficiency and fixed them. Following this achievement, I was given responsibility for **ownership** of these processes and spreadsheets.

* I increased the efficiency of the new department I was promoted to, for example, automating and enhancing the Monday trade reports.

**Communication**

* Experience in **pair programming** and communicating desired code. 

* During my philosophy degree at Bristol university we discussed complex philosophical theories that required communicating with **clarity** and evidence to reduce the risk of mis-understanding.

* While I was waitressing, I gave instructions to my peers in a **pressurised environment** to help avoid any injuries or errors occurring. This successful communication resulted in my becoming a team ambassador in charge of the wellbeing and organisation of the staff on duty.

* At Crew Clothing I was asked to work for the menswear, womenswear and the accessories teams simultaneously. I contributed to a **cohesive environment** between these departments and I frequently taught my peers skills I had developed. I became the go-to person to provide essential skills for new starters within the teams.
